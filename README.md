1.To run the project , just clone the project and install dependencies and run command nodemon index.js.
2.In an Api , the instruction was to check the permission to user to create subfolder , for this i checked if the current logged in user is same as the user who created that folder.
3.Searching and sorting are best suited on frontend , I implemented two demo react components for them.
4. Best design practises like modularity and error handling etc have been followed.
5.For asynchronous programming , i used both promise based architecture and aysnc/await functionality just to convey my expertise in both.
